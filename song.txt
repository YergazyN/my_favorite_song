Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored?
Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore?
We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
There are things that we can have, but can't keep
If they say

Who cares if one more light goes out?
In a sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
We're quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

The reminders pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there
If they say

Who cares if one more light goes out?
In a sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?…

Стоило остаться — неужели были знаки, которые я не смог распознать?
Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore?
Могу ли я помочь тебе больше не чувствовать боль?
We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
Мы лицезрели великолепие, когда мир засыпал.
There are things that we can have, but can't keep
Кое-что может прийти в твою жизнь, но это невозможно удержать.
